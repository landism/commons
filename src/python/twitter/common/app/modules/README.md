# Twitter Common App Modules

These are helpers that can be added to a program which uses `twitter.common.app`. Unfortunately, these are really only useful _if you are including the source alongside your application_.

# WARNING

Do not depend upon these if you are using the distribution published on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter.common.app)!

There is no `twitter.common.app.modules` dist, and one will *not* exist until a successor to `twitter.common.app` is designed, built, and released. Due to some complexities with namespace packages, publishing `twitter.common.app.modules` as a dist will never resolve correctly. [PEP 382](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0382/) contains the full set of details, and there was also some discussion in [r/1767/](https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1767/).
